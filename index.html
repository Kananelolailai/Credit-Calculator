            <h3>Payment Terms and Credit Process</h3>
            <p>Thank you for your interest in purchasing a phone or laptop on credit/installment (buy now and pay later over a period of 12 months).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Credit Provider:</strong> Lai Lai Essentials is <strong>not</strong> an accredited credit provider. For credit-related transactions, we partner with <strong>Mobicred</strong>, a third-party company that processes credit applications, determines your eligibility, and assesses the available credit amount. To apply for credit, please visit <a href="https://live.mobicred.co.za/web_mcrliv/run.w?run=application" target="_blank">Mobicred's application portal</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Credit Allocation:</strong> Credit will be allocated by Mobicred. Once your application is approved and the credit is allocated, Lai Lai Essentials will provide the phone or device. After your application is approved, you must return to Lai Lai Essentials to choose your preferred item. You will then use the allocated credit to purchase the item directly on our website.</li>
                <li><strong>Inquiries:</strong> Any inquiries or questions regarding your credit application should be directed to Mobicred directly, as they handle the credit process.</li>
                <li><strong>Declined Applications:</strong> In the event that Mobicred declines your application for any reason, Lai Lai Essentials is unable to assist further. However, we offer an alternative payment method called <strong>Lay-by</strong>, where you can receive the device only after completing payment in full.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To help you estimate your monthly payments for a 12-month period, please use the calculator form below. This will provide you with a rough estimation of how much you will be paying each month.</p>
